     * SizeWatcher observes size of an element and notifies when its size is changed. It doesn't use any timeouts
     * to check the element size, when change in size occurs a callback method immediately invoked.
     *
     * To watch for element's size changes the element, and other required elements are appended to a container element
     * you specify, and which must be added to the DOM tree before invoking prepareForWatch() method. Your container
     * element should be positioned outside of client's visible area. Therefore you shouldn't use SizeWatcher to watch
     * for size changes of elements used for UI.
     * Such container element could be a simple <div> that is a child of the <body> element:
     * <div style="position:absolute; left:-10000px; top:-10000px;"></div>
     *
     * You must invoke SizeWatcher's methods in a specific order to establish size change listeners:
     *
     * 1. Create SizeWatcher instance by invoke SizeWatcher constructor passing the element (size of which you want to
     *    observe), the container element, the delegate object and optional size parameter of type Size which should be
     *    the pre-calculated initial size of your element.
     * 4. Invoke prepareForWatch() method. This method will calculate element size if you didn't passed it to the constructor.
     * 5. Invoke beginWatching() method. This method will set event listeners and invoke your delegate's method once
     *    element size changes.
     *
     * Failing to invoke above methods in their predefined order will throw an exception.
     *
     * @param {HTMLElement}   element An element, size of which will be observed for changes.
     * @param {Object}        options
     * @param {HTMLElement}   options.container An element to which special observing elements will be added. Must be in DOM tree
     *                        when prepareForWatch() method is called.
     * @param {Object}        options.delegate A delegate object with a sizeWatcherChangedSize method which will be invoked, in
     *                        context of the delegate object, when change in size occurs. This method is invoked with single
     *                        parameter which is the current SizeWatcher instance.
     * @param {Size}          [options.size] The pre-calculated initial size of your element. When passed, the element is not
     *                        asked for offsetWidth and offsetHeight, which may be useful to reduce browser's CSS
     *                        recalculations. If you will not pass the size parameter then its size calculation will be
     *                        deferred to prepareForWatch() method.
     * @param {Boolean}       [options.continuous=false] A boolean flag indicating if the SizeWatcher will watch only for
     *                        the first size change (default) or will continuously watch for size changes.
     * @param {Number}        [options.direction=SizeWatcher.directions.both] The direction of size change that should be
     *                        watched: SizeWatcher.directions.increase, SizeWatcher.directions.decrease or
     *                        SizeWatcher.directions.both

     *                        watched: SizeWatcher.dimensions.horizontal, SizeWatcher.dimensions.vertical or
     *                        SizeWatcher.dimensions.both
