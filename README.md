## Code Navigation
All the source files are located in the `public/src` folder. The index html is located in `public/src/html/index.html`

As the project is hosted on Firebase, all source files are minified and packaged by Webpack, with the minified files located in the `public/dist` folder. The Webpack configuration is located in `public/webpack.config.js`.
